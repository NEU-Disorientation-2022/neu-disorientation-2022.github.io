title: "Mental Health, Sexual Assault, and Other Wellness Resources on Campus"
---
<p>Over the years, Northeastern has created a variety of programs to address sexual assault, sexual health, mental health, and trauma on campus. While some of these resources are helpful, Northeastern’s University Health and Counseling Services and other programs at Northeastern are still failing to provide adequate and necessary care for all students. Below, we have listed NEU resources that are currently available to students, initiatives going on to address NEU’s shortcomings, and resources out in the larger Boston area.</p>
<h2>Resources at Northeastern</h2>
<h3>UHCS</h3>
<p>Northeastern’s University Health and Counseling Services, or UHCS for short, is responsible for all physical and mental healthcare associated with the university. If you are staying at the Boston campus, there is a physical office where they accept walk-in and scheduled appointments for all undergraduate and graduate students. Currently, walk-in appointments have been suspended due to the pandemic. UHCS also offers different weekly support groups. If you are looking for assistance with mental health, contacting UHCS at 617.373.2772 is one option.</p>
<h3>Find@Northeastern</h3>
<p>Northeastern also has a program called Find@Northeastern, which is a 24/7 MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT hotline 877.233.9477 (U.S.) or 781.457.7777 (Intl.). Find@Northeastern will instantly connect you with a trained counselor who can talk to you in the moment and assist you in finding a local or virtual therapist that can schedule session times that work for you. The first five of those sessions each fall and spring semester are free for all students.</p>
<h3>OPEN and Sexual Violence Resource Center</h3>
<p>The Office of Prevention and Education, or OPEN, provides prevention and education services on the topics of alcohol and other drugs, sexual violence, and sexual health. The Sexual Violence Resource Center, housed under OPEN, is dedicated to helping Northeastern students affected by sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual exploitation or abuse, domestic violence, and/or stalking. They serve students who have been affected personally (recently or in the past) and those who are looking for resources to support others. Their services are free, confidential, and trauma-informed. Other institutions on campus, such as ResLife employees (like RAs) are mandated reporters, meaning they are legally obligated to create a record if they are notified an instance of assault has occurred. Aside from OPEN, there are a few other confidential resources on campus: UHCS and Center for Spirituality Dialogue & Service.</p>

<h3>Frisky Husky</h3>
<p>During the Fall and Spring semesters, students can order safe-sex supplies through Frisky Husky six times a semester. The program delivers free external condoms, internal condoms, oral dams, and water-based lubricant right to your mailbox in discreet packaging. Due to the current pandemic, there is added risk in engaging in sexual behaviors so please take necessary precautions.</p>

<h2>Room to Improve</h2>
<h3>Mental Health and Trauma Resources</h3>
<p>Currently, Find@Northeastern only offers 5 free therapy sessions per semester, which for many is not enough. Additionally, there is on campus counseling at UHCS, but there is insufficient personnel compared to the size of the student body.</p>
<h3>Title IX Office</h3>
<p>Many Northeastern students have shared their first hand experiences of the Title IX office (or Office of University Equity and Compliance) mishandling cases of sexual assault. From unnecessary police presence, to drawn-out timelines, there seems to be a lack of accountability at the the Title IX office, which is responsible for handling all cases of gender-based discrimination. However, organizations like The Sexual Assault Response Coalition are working to bring better, survivor-centered resources to campus to ensure the complete safety and health of all Northeastern students. SARC seeks to make Northeastern University a safer space for survivors of sexual assault and intimate partner violence.</p>

<h3>STI Testing</h3>
<p>Currently, Northeastern does NOT offer free and confidential STI testing to students. Instead, UHCS offers a self-pay STI testing program, which requires undergraduate and graduate students to pay $75 out of pocket at the time of the appointment. There is a second option for students to have UHCS bill their health insurance, however this is not confidential. If a student wants to receive free and confidential STI testing, they must travel to Fenway Health or its adjacent services at BAGLY or Sidney Borum, Jr. Health Center. On campus, NU SHARE, a student organization, hosts a “Get Yourself Tested Day” event where students can receive this service, but they have a limited number of tests and it only occurs once a semester. In addition to offering/advocating for better STI testing services, NU Sexual Health Advocacy, Resources, and Education (NU SHARE) seeks to create spaces for NU students passionate about reproductive justice to learn, educate each other, and take action. If you would like to learn more about their meetings, workshops, or projects, email them at <a href="mailto:northeasternshare@gmail.com">northeasternshare@gmail.com</a> or follow their Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/northeasternshare/">@northeasternshare</a>.</p>
<h2>Resources in Boston</h2>
<p>We recognize that the mental health and trauma response services available at UHCS and elsewhere on campus may come with long waiting times and other challenges.
