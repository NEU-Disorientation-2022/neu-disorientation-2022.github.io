title: "Adjunct Faculty Union: What Is It and Why We Need It"
---
<p>September 3, 2015 was a warm, sunny move-in day at Northeastern; campus had that special, start-of-semester energy, when everything feels full of possibility. But colleagues and I were on campus that day filled with frustration rather than optimism. Adjunct faculty had spent almost a year trying to negotiate a collective bargaining agreement with Northeastern administration, and we were getting nowhere. To garner support from the campus community, we spent move-in day handing out information and talking to students, parents, faculty, and staff about the adjunct union&rsquo;s efforts to achieve better pay, job security, and greater say in our working conditions.</p>

<p>Everyone we spoke with was friendly and almost all were supportive, but we were shocked by the uniformity of responses: blank stares.</p>

<p>Turns out, most students had never heard the term &ldquo;adjunct&rdquo; and had no idea that professors were not all considered equal, and most everyone was unaware that part-time faculty had been fighting the administration so hard for so long to reach a union contract.</p>

<p>Seven years later, a lot has happened, but a lack of awareness about adjunct faculty and their working conditions persists. So, let&rsquo;s unpack this:</p>

<h3>What is an adjunct?</h3>
<p>Adjunct faculty at Northeastern are:</p>
<ul>
    <li>&ldquo;part-time&rdquo; employees&mdash;even though some teach the same number of (or more!) courses per semester than full-time faculty.</li>
    <li>not eligible for the same benefits, such as health insurance, as full-time faculty and staff.</li>
    <li>hired for one semester at a time and, therefore, don&rsquo;t receive University communications, about vital issues like COVID policies, during semesters we don&rsquo;t teach.</li>
    <li>not listed as the instructor for a course until about a month before the semester starts, so students often can&rsquo;t choose to take a course with a specific faculty member.</li>
    <li>paid per course; this means we&rsquo;re not compensated for labor beyond what is required to prepare and teach our courses. So, if an adjunct serves on a committee, attends department meetings, or writes a letter of recommendation for a student, they are doing so on their own time, without pay.</li>
</ul>
