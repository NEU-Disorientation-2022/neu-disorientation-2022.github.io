  <li><a href="https://archive.org/details/missionhillandthemiracleofboston/missionhillandthemiracleofbostonreel1.mov"><em>Mission Hill and the Miracle of Boston by Richard Broadman</em></a>: “Once a predominantly Irish neighborhood of houses, churches, and small stores, after World War II Boston's Mission Hill began to change: thousands of units of public housing were built - and allowed to decay there; nearby hospitals expanded, displacing people from their homes; developers and speculators bought and sold property and built twenty-story apartment buildings. A new, poor population and an affluent professional population arrived to compete for parts of the old neighborhood. Through the voices of the people of Mission Hill, the film tells the story of urban renewal, racial conflict, and the struggle of a neighborhood to survive through changing times. Special award winner, Boston Society of Film Critics, 1984.”</li>
    <li><a href="https://vimeo.com/40582561"><em>Equal or Better: The Story of the Silver Line</em></a>: “In 1987 the Washington Street Elevated train was torn down and the minority community of Roxbury was left without rapid transit for the first time since 1901. Equal or Better follows the story of a misstated promise to three Boston communities and the issues of equality still present in our countries transportation priorities.”</li>
